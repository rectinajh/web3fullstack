## 1. Preface

As a fullstack development engineer on blockchain, the blogger knows the importance of growth. Most of the current market is API engineer; Is only able to use API does not understand the principle, in the long run, become replaceable people, how to become a senior development engineer! That's what it takes to be a senior development engineer! Follow my blog to learn, you can understand the web3 full stack engineer knowledge system, to get their own learning direction.
